        Leinster is one of the Provinces of Ireland situated in the east of Ireland.
         It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster. Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland,
          the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both,
           thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster. The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes.
         In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties.
